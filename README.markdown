The Keep My Opt-Outs project is now part of the
Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Program.
Google has worked with the DAA to include the
Keep My Opt-Outs functionality in the DAA's
[Protect My Choices](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/protect-my-choices/hdgloanjhdcenjgiafkpbehddcnonlic).
Because of this, Google has ceased maintaining this
project. You can still use the code as is under the
applicable license(s), but this project is not going
to accept or receive changes anymore.
